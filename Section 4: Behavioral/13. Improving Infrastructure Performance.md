I improved infrastructure performance by migrating applications from Docker Swarm to AWS ECS and EKS. This migration was motivated by the need for better scalability, reliability, and integration with cloud-native services.

Challenges Faced
Stakeholder Buy-In on Cloud Costs
Initially, stakeholders were hesitant due to concerns over cloud costs. I addressed this by conducting a detailed cost-benefit analysis, comparing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) between the on-premises Docker Swarm setup and AWS-managed services.

I highlighted how ECS and EKS could reduce infrastructure management overhead and improve scalability.
I used tools like AWS Pricing Calculator and detailed how using Reserved Instances and Savings Plans would lower operational costs.
Service Downtime During Migration

Migrating live applications without downtime was a key challenge. To address this:

I implemented blue-green deployments on ECS for zero-downtime migration.
For EKS, I used canary deployments with traffic splitting to test the Kubernetes workloads while keeping the old services operational.
Application Compatibility
Some applications required modifications to work seamlessly in a Kubernetes environment. For instance:

I updated container configurations to include readiness and liveness probes.
Managing Stateful Workloads

Moving stateful applications from Docker Swarm to EKS required careful planning:
I used Amazon EBS for persistent storage.
I leveraged EFS for shared storage across pods.

Improvements Achieved
Scalability: Applications can now scale seamlessly with Kubernetes’ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and ECS’s Service Auto Scaling.
Resiliency: EKS’ self-healing mechanisms improved uptime by automatically replacing failed pods.
Observability: Built unified monitoring systems using Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry, enabling real-time observability.
Deployment Speed: CI/CD pipelines were re-engineered with GitOps principles, reducing deployment times by 30%.

Key Technologies Used:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automated infrastructure provisioning and deployment processes with Terraform, Ansible, and Python, streamlining production and staging environments on AWS (EC2, ECS, and EKS).
Service Mesh and Security: Integrated Istio for microservices communication and service discovery.
Enforced CIS benchmarks, Falco for runtime security, RBAC policies, and vulnerability scanning with Kube-Scan and Checkov.
CI/CD Enhancements:

Enhanced pipelines with:

SonarQube for code quality checks.
Trivy for container vulnerability scanning.
OWASP ZAP for Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
InSpec for compliance scanning.

Monitoring and Observability:
Developed real-time monitoring systems using Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry.
Enabled early detection of performance bottlenecks and security incidents.

QA Automation:
Automated testing processes using Cypress within Bitbucket Pipelines and Python scripts, ensuring faster and more reliable testing cycles.

Application Migration:
Successfully migrated containerized applications from Docker Swarm and EC2 to AWS ECS and EKS, improving scalability, operational efficiency, and alignment with cloud-native best practices.
