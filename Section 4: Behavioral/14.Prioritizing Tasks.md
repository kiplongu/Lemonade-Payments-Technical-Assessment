Evaluate Impact:
I quickly assess each issue's impact on the business, prioritizing tasks like production outages over less critical ones, such as a failed staging build.

Communicate Clearly:
I inform stakeholders about the situation, align priorities, and delegate tasks to my team if available. This ensures everyone is on the same page.

Use a Framework:
I mentally apply something like the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into urgent/important, focusing on what requires immediate attention.

Stay Focused and Documented:
I focus on resolving one issue at a time, starting with the most critical. I document the process for transparency and root cause analysis later.
