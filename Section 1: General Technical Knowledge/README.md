1. # What are the key security concerns when it comes to DevOps?
I will ensure secrets management is handled securely by using tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets. I would implement proper access control using RBAC to restrict permissions based on roles. I will regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair. I would also secure the CI/CD pipeline by preventing code tampering and using encryption for credentials during build and deployment processes. I will establish monitoring and auditing to keep track of unauthorized access or any suspicious activity. Finally, I would validate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files using tools like Checkov or tfsec to prevent misconfigurations.

2. # How do you design a self-healing distributed service?
I will implement health checks (readiness and liveness probes) in Kubernetes to automatically restart failed services. I would configure auto-scaling so that if service demand spikes, more instances are automatically provisioned. I will deploy services with redundancy across multiple nodes or regions to prevent single points of failure. I would also use a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures between microservices. I will ensure continuous monitoring through tools like Prometheus and Grafana, setting up alerts for system anomalies. Finally, I would ensure that there are rollback mechanisms in place to revert to previous stable states in case of failure.

3. # Describe a centralized logging solution and how you can implement logging for a microservice architecture
I will set up a centralized logging system using the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK (Fluentd instead of Logstash) stack. I would configure Fluentd or Logstash agents as sidecars in my microservices to collect logs and send them to Elasticsearch. I will also implement structured logging within my applications to make logs easier to query. I would integrate trace IDs and span IDs using distributed tracing tools like OpenTelemetry, so I can trace the flow of requests across services. For visualization, I will use Kibana dashboards to monitor and analyze the logs.

4. # What are some reasons for choosing Terraform for DevOps?
I will choose Terraform because it allows me to define infrastructure as code, making the process repeatable, version-controlled, and auditable. I would use its state management feature to track changes and ensure that the infrastructure remains consistent with the code. I will also benefit from modular design, which helps in creating reusable configurations for multiple environments. I would choose Terraform because it supports multiple cloud providers, giving me flexibility in managing resources across AWS, GCP, Azure, and others. Terraform’s plan and apply functionality provides a clear, pre-deployment validation, ensuring that I avoid unexpected changes.

5. # How would you design and implement a secure CI/CD architecture for microservice deployment using GitOps?
I will design the CI/CD pipeline with GitOps principles, where the source of truth for both application code and infrastructure is stored in Git. I would use ArgoCD or FluxCD for automated deployment to Kubernetes, ensuring the Kubernetes manifests are versioned and tracked in a Git repository. I will configure CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to build and test microservices and scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy. I would implement secrets management by using HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Sealed Secrets for storing sensitive information. I will set up RBAC in both CI/CD pipelines and GitOps tools to ensure the least privilege access. Finally, I would configure monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana to track the health of the pipeline and deployed services.

# Low-Level Architectural Diagram (Text Description):
Developers push code to Git.
CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) builds the image and runs tests.
Artifact Repository (Docker Registry) stores the image.
GitOps Tool (ArgoCD, FluxCD) monitors the Git repository for changes in manifests.
Kubernetes Cluster updates the running service based on the new manifest.

6. # You notice React Native builds are failing intermittently. What’s your debugging process?
I will start by reviewing the build logs to pinpoint the error message and see if it’s related to network issues, timeouts, or misconfigurations. I would verify that the build environment has enough resources and that the build process isn’t being throttled. I will clear the cache using npm start -- --reset-cache or yarn start -- --reset-cache to eliminate issues from stale dependencies. I would also check the dependencies to ensure everything is up to date and not causing conflicts, especially if there were recent updates to React Native. If the issue happens intermittently in the CI/CD pipeline, I will test locally and try to replicate the issue to better understand the problem. Additionally, I will check for network issues (API timeouts or slow connections) that might affect the build. I would run the build with verbose logging to get more detailed output, which might help in tracing the cause of failure.
